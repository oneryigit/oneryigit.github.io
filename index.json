The conventional understanding is that whenever religion becomes noticeable in conflicts, it is primarily used for instrumentalist objectives. Scholars argue that religious instrumentalization in conflict occurs when groups have differing religious identities. However, this study shows that religious instrumentalization in ethnic conflict can still occur when the groups have similar religious identities. The study utilizes the text-as-data approach and employs computer-automated topic modeling algorithms to extract the topics covered in weekly Friday sermons during peace negotiations with PKK and periods of cross-border military operations against Kurdish insurgents. The results show that the topic of Islamic brotherhood is associated with the peace process period, and the topic of nationalist discourse in sermons is associated with periods of intensive cross-border military operations. The findings provide evidence that when religion is nationalized, states can utilize religion as a tool to justify their actions and policies during ethnic conflicts for both boosting and curbing nationalism.","tags":["Religious instrumentalization","Text Analysis","Turkey","Kurds"],"title":"Boosting and curbing nationalism Instrumentalization of religion in ethnic conflict in Turkey [working paper]","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Öner Yigit"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1712448000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1712448000,"objectID":"957f467e8471e6fcee579e2cd5755e24","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/publication/preprint2/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/preprint2/","section":"publication","summary":"Why do some ethnic minorities support group rights while others do not? Prior studies have primarily focused on the influence of conflict exposure on support for pro-ethnic parties. This paper demonstrates that while not all minorities support ethnic parties, they still advocate for certain group rights, such as the recognition of ethnolinguistic and cultural rights. I argue that the traumatic legacy of forced displacement deepens ethnic identities and divisions between us and them. Similarly, increased violence in conflict-affected areas reinforces ethnic identity awareness and bolsters support for more comprehensive ethnic group rights. Utilizing national survey data from Kurds in Turkey and geo-located conflict event data, this study reveals a strong association between exposure to political violence, forced displacement, and support for group rights among Kurds in Turkey. These findings enhance our understanding of the impact of conflict exposure on behaviors and introduce a novel method for assessing support for group rights, moving beyond mere ethnic-party allegiance.","tags":["Conflict Exposure","Turkey","Kurds"],"title":"Conflict Exposure and support for group rights [working paper]","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1699142400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1699142400,"objectID":"a47e12ac67c7ea5aceacb57932e5cb4d","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/talk/communal-violence-event-database/","publishdate":"2023-11-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/communal-violence-event-database/","section":"event","summary":"This database aims to collect the communal violence events such as lynch against minorities and migrants.","tags":null,"title":"Communal Violence Event Database","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!

This paper questions whether the amount of foreign aid received is associated with a decline in religious discrimination in recipient states. It provides an alternative explanation and highlights the importance of foreign aid assistance and its relationship with a component of human rights, discrimination against religious minorities.

A growing body of research indicates that state support for religion is linked to higher levels of political violence. Scholars argue that in countries where Islam is the dominant religion, the majority religious group is more prone to engaging in political violence as a result of the preferential treatment given to the majority religion by the state. This implies that when the state supports the religion of the majority, it emboldens religious groups to perpetrate more acts of violence. However, this paper challenges these assertions and presents evidence to contradict them. This paper argues that there is a need to reexamine and disaggregate the notion of ``state support for religion\" as many studies overlook the fact that government support for religion can be understood in several ways. We argue that when governments heavily intervene in religious affairs, the spread of radical religious ideologies and organizations across borders is curbed. This is due to the fact that states impose restrictions on religious teachings and closely monitor religious organizations, while advocating for a more moderate interpretation of the religion that does not pose a challenge to the state and aligns with national interests.","tags":null,"title":"Nationalization of the religious sphere and political violence perpetrated by religious actors [working paper]","type":"publication"},{"authors":["","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
